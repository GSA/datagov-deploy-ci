# datagov-deploy-ci

Configures a host to automatically run the ansible playbooks and log the
results. This is used in firewalled environments where third-party CI solution
is unavailable.


## Requirements

N/A

## Usage

After you run the playbook, there are two manual steps:

- Configure the user with the Ansible Vault key
- Configure the user with the SSH key to use

For data.gov, this usually copying the files over from the root user:

```shell
sudo cp /root/ansible-secret.txt /home/ci/
sudo chown ci:ci /home/ci/ansible-secret.txt
sudo cp /root/.ssh/ckan-csw-aws.pem /home/ci/.ssh/
sudo chown ci:ci /home/ci/.ssh/ckan-csw-aws.pem
```


## Role variables

**ci_inventory** string **required**

The ansible inventory to run the CI script against.

**ci_username** string

The Linux user account to create for running the CI script.

**ci_home_dir** string

Home directory for the CI user.

**ci_log_dir** string

The directory to log to. You may want to configure logrotate for /var/log/ci.log
to avoid the file growing too large.
